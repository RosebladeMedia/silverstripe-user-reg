# User registration / login module

This module creates a public login and registration form for users to sign up and log into your platform through the main site.

Parts are based on the abandoned module by [i-lateral](https://packagist.org/packages/i-lateral/silverstripe-users).

It uses the existing Member classes and groups but with additional configuration, including a front-end control panel.

You can customise parts of this module through various configuration points, but it's recommended you follow the below docs to get started:

* [Installation](Installation.md)
* [Configuration](Configuration.md)
* [Usage and examples](Usage.md)
* [Extensions](Extensions.md)
